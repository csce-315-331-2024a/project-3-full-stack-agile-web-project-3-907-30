## Summary
Overall, we are making progress through some troublesome features, but they are getting done. The progress on testing is slow, but it is coming along. We have an issue with getting the coverage report on our api routes, but we will be asking prof. Ritchey tomorrow in class. We believe we will be able to finsish all of our core features, but we do not have that much time left. 

## Minutes from Previous Meeting
FoF - 3.7
Overall, the team is continuing to trying to push through the remaining big tasks. We have made some breakthroughs in testing, but have not fully figured it out just yet. Gabe is coming back from sickness and Aaron is going to be working with him to finish the menu management features. The confidence is slightly higher after the breakthroughs, but there is still a lot left to do, and the team wants to put their heads down and grind it out.

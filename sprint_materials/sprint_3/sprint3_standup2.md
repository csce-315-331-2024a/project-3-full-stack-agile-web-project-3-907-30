## Summary
Overall, the team is continuing to trying to push through the remaining big tasks. We have made some breakthroughs in testing, but have not fully figured it out just yet. Gabe is coming back from sickness and Aaron is going to be working with him to finish the menu management features. The confidence is slightly higher after the breakthroughs, but there is still a lot left to do, and the team wants to put their heads down and grind it out. 

## Minutes from Previous Meeting
FoF - 3.4
Overall, our decision to start the sprint early has paid off. Two of our teammembers have already finished their tasks, which is a major help considering Gabe has come down with an illness and has not been able to work very much. We started off with a heavy push, and even though the testing task seems daunting, we belive we can finish if we push through.

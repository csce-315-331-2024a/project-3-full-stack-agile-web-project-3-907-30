## Meeting Minutes

### What features are we all happiest with
- Chris: Seasonal items, Rev AI assistant
- Margo: Cart for customer ordering, trend reports
- Akshay: Customer ordering view, Rev AI assistant
- Aaron: Rev AI assistant
- Adam: Sale functionality, Rev AI assistant
- Gabe: Rev AI assistant

### What part of our features would we like to improve/tweak looking back
- Margo: Refactoring code, some parts are duplicated and API routes are redundant
- Aaron: Project is already good, testing can be improved upon
- Akshay: API routes can be more efficient, not as many is needed. Backend is solid though
- Adam: No scrolling on menu boards, don't hardcode IDs in employee order view
- Chris: Descriptions for menu items, ingredients maybe feasible
- Gabe: More testing, and feedback from TA needs to be implemented

### What parts of the user studies will we implement in our design moving forward
- Margo: Reordering implementation, seeing menu items in your past order
- Aaron: Logo returning back to customer order view, dark mode
- Adam: Logo redirects back to customer order view, nicely formatted ingredients
- Akshay: Format ingredient display better
- Chris: Showing ingredients nicer and past order items
- Gabe: Similar thoughts to Chris

### What do we feel were the biggest blockers/what went wrong during the sprint
- Adam: Testing was the biggest blocker, setting it up was a hassle
- Akshay: Similar to Adam, testing was hard to setup and coverage was hard as well
- Chris: Same as Adam and Akshay
- Gabe: Again, same as the previous comments
- Margo: Testing and sheer number of chores held us back a bit
- Aaron: Figuring out how to update ingredients for menu items

### What could we change to make those blockers disappear/general changes for a future project
- Margo: Start testing earlier (from sprint 1), having a clear framework and workflow for testing
- Aaron: Getting more familiar with React and how forms work
- Adam: Agree with Margo, start testing earlier
- Akshay: Test earlier, design backend architecture more robustly in sprint 1
- Chris: Understanding form schema better in React
- Gabe: Test earlier, finding a better framework that has better test compatibility, such as Python or Java

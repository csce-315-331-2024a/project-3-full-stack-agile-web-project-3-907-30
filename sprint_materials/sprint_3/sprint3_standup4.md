Testing is still proving to be the most difficult part of the project workload, but the app is very close to being a fully realized version of the initial vision. We are more confident now that we will finish everything. This last push will be strong. 

## Minutes from Previous Meeting
FoF - 3.5
Overall, we are making progress through some troublesome features, but they are getting done. The progress on testing is slow, but it is coming along. We have an issue with getting the coverage report on our api routes, but we will be asking prof. Ritchey tomorrow in class. We believe we will be able to finsish all of our core features, but we do not have that much time left.

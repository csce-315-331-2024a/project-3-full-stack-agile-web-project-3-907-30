## Minutes from Previous Meeting
FoF - 4.5
Overall, this sprint is starting off strong. By finishing our chores and making tweaks first, we are giving ourselves more time and space to implement our new features in detail. There haven't been any major roadblocks aside from some debugging, so the path ahead seems clear. We will be using today to continue our strong momentum.

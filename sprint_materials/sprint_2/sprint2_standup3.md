## Summary
Overall, the team picked it back up yesterday and got a lot done. We are on track to completing all of our stories on time. Because Margo is now done with her stories, she will be able to help the rest of the team with development. I (Gabe) got sick and that hurt my workflow, but I am going to be home and should be able to get a lot done while resting. 

## Minutes from Previous Meeting
FoF - 4.5
Overall, while yesterday was not as productive as a workday as we hoped, we are still confident in our abilities. Margo was able to complete a story, and while only she completed one yesterday, the rest of us are in progress on ours. While yesterday was not as strong a push as possible, we have not grinded to a halt, and we will pick things up today.

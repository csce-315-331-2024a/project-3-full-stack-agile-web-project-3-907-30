### Assign stories to the team
- Clean up tasks that we have done for each person for last sprint, so we can see what stories and tasks are left to be done
- Each person looked at the remaining stories and tasks and picked what they wanted to do for Sprint 2
- Some large stories (such as trends) are split between multiple people in our team
- Google Translate API implementation will be done by Chris

### Clear up any confusing tasks from selected stories
- Some of the tasks for trends were confusing and allergen information were confusing, so we had to clear them up
- Margo explained how she would implement the allergen information pop-ups
- All the other tasks were self-explanatory and understood by our team members.

### Add and assign chores (0 point tasks)
- Weather API implementation was added as a chore
- Cleaning up the UI for the entire POS system was also added as a chore
- Reconfiguring the database for making items on sale

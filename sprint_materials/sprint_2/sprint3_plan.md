# SPRINT TWO: 4/18/24 - 4/28/24

## Sprint Goal:
The main goal of the third sprint of this project is to deliver a final product that implements all necessary functionality, is accessible to a wide range of users, and adds novel features. 

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
A product in which all users have a robust and fully-featured experience. Managers can fully interact with their ordering, menu item, and inventory systems. Customers can place orders from their view, implementing their rewards in this experience as well. The system integrates the functionality of outside API's to enrich the user experience.

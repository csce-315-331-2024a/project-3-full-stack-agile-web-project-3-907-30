## Summary


## Minutes from Previous Meeting
Overall, up to today, we are making good progress. Our main roadblocks are still just setup bottlenecks; we are waiting for each other while we all figure out basics. However, our communication is strong and everybody is on the same page. Aaron will be taking on some other teammembers tasks to lighten their load because some of his tasks overlapped with others and were already completed. We are adding a new task to add a customer managing view to the manager page. Everyone will be completing their remaining tasks and begin adding tests as they develop.

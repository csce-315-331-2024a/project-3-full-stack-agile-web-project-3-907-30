## Summary
Overall, we are getting started without too much issue. Of course, many of us are completely new to Next.js, and have not used neither Node or React, so it will take a little bit of time to learn. However, we do have some expertise in the group and they are taking a leaderhip role in steering us in the right direction coding-wise. The group does believe that it is very possible to finish all in a timely manner, but we do not have great confidence yet with this new framework.

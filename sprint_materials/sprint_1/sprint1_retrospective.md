## Meeting Minutes

### What features are we all happiest with
- Adam: Like the OAuth feature because it sets up the layout, and the employee ordering system
- Chris: Customers can see items visually, with the ingredients, name, and price alongside it
- Akshay: Different types of menu views available (employee, customer, menu board) and look good
- Margo: Ordering system works because getting it working was hard, and low stock notification
- Aaron: Like customer ordering pictures, and organization is nice
- Gabriel: The points and reward system works well, all features are good in general

### What part of our features would we like to improve/tweak looking back
- Aaron: The employee view on the manager page can be reorganized, customer card in manager view, have employee ID be -1 when self-ordering
- Margo: Improve the employee POS system, the receipt and items listed, wish it was all laid out instead
- Akshay: Improve the employee view as well, found a few bugs and issues that should be fixed, need more functionality and features. Fixing employee ordering bug: does not fully clear prev order when clear button clicked
- Chris: Make employee POS system not scrollable, slows down order as a cashier. Receipt can be smaller and take less space
- Adam: Make the employee and customer order view need to be one page.
- Gabe: Agree with everyone else, make a sign-up button for customer log-in, customer ordering functionality, and have tab for categories for customer order

### What parts of the user studies will we implement in our design moving forward
- Adam: Making things on one page instead of scrollable, have dollar signs on prices, make ingredients formatted well
- Chris: Have categories, order functionality for customer self-checkout
- Akshay: Stick to 2-3 colors, buttons have text so they can see what it does, make menus not scrollable, photos not true-to-life
- Gabe: Clear organization, windows and cards are well placed, photos are nice, likes maroon theme, sign-up as a customer, can't do anything with points so far, a user shouldn't be able to go to the employee view, menu board be on theme, more refined customer experience
- Margo and Aaron have not completed user studies yet due to stringent schedules

### What do we feel were the biggest blockers/what went wrong during the sprint
- Adam: Overlapping tasks, separate tasks by story, makes it easier and less merge conflicts
- Aaron: Split tasks more evenly, and everyone should have around the same commits, lack of clarity
- Akshay: Similarly, overlapping tasks and it is hard to work with it
- Margo: Had to wait on some features to be implemented to work, overlapping tasks again
- Chris: Learning React was a blocker, and some things need to be more clear, lack of clarity
- Gabe: Tracking everybody's process, setting up the workflow, scrum master tasks took a long time, overlapping tasks

### What should we change to make those blockers disappear
- Adam: Hard to keep track of tasks throughout the sprint, need a centralized place
- Gabe: Have everybody mark done what they have done in the markdown file in every PR or commit, this proposed workflow should be the basis of the sprint. Mark tasks done every day as well, assign everyone a story to complete, make sure to clear up every task for the next sprint planning
- Chris: More clarity in where to check tasks
- Margo: Same things as everyone else mentioned
- Aaron: Similar to other people said
- Akshay: Not much else to change, already mentioned before

### Any other new tasks (0 point tasks a.k.a chores) that we should add to our product backlog
- Gabe: Chores are 0 point tasks that don't add to the overall points of the project but still need to be done
- Akshay: Delete item on order-receipt functionality, latest itemID display functionality on order-receipt, fix employee ordering bug: does not fully clear prev order when clear button clicked
- Adam: Testing for our application
- Margo: Weather API implementation

### Set time for Sprint 2 planning meeting
- Wednesday April 3, after 4:15 PM

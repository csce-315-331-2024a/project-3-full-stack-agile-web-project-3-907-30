- For next sprints, assign stories rather than tasks, so there is less overlap - All
- Start writing tests for our completed features - All

## Fist of five result 
- average of ~4 -> high confidence

## Summary
Overall, up to today, we are making good progress. Our main roadblocks are still just setup bottlenecks; we are waiting for each other while we all figure out basics. However, our communication is strong and everybody is on the same page. Aaron will be taking on some other teammembers tasks to lighten their load because some of his tasks overlapped with others and were already completed. We are adding a new task to add a customer managing view to the manager page. Everyone will be completing their remaining tasks and begin adding tests as they develop. 

## Minutes from Previous Meeting
FoF - 3.5
Overall, we have a solid foundation and are slowly but surely finishing work and building momentum. While we may only have one story really finished, it is a foundational one and will make other feature implementations much easier. We still are not supremely confident with using our new framework, and we don't have much to show for yet, so confidence is still moderate. However, the next day of work will provide great results.

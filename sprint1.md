# SPRINT ONE: 3/22/24 - 3/29/24

## Sprint Goal:
The main goal of the first sprint of this project is to create and deploy a working product that has the basic features of our previous POS system implemented. Our product will be hosted on a website and accessible by the necessary parties at any time after this sprint's deliverable date has passed. 

### MVP
A product where a customer, manager, or employee can securely login and access the basic functions of our system in addition to a passive menu board view. This product will be hosted online and available to anyone who needs to access it from 3/29/24.
